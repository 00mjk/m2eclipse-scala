0.0.5 (wip)
-----
* use assembla as "project host" to be under Scala-IDE umbrella

0.0.4
-----

* include a workaround to run JUnit test, but right-click on JUnit test doesn't propose 'Run as unit test'. Tu run as junit :
  * select source file and use keybord shortcut (Alt+Shit+X T)
    * source file have to be named with test class name and being in the 'right' directory (like in java)
    * I only test with annotation (see source of samples projects listed on wiki)
  * create JUnit Launch configuration

0.0.3
-----

* try to fix a issue (NPE) if default folders doesn't exist

0.0.2
-----

* auto add "src/main/scala" and "src/test/scala" if you don't use goal "add-sources" (nor <sourceDirectory>)
* add samples project http://github.com/davidB/m2e-scala/tree/master/samples/
* put documentation at https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/scala-ide/With_M2Eclipse

0.0.1
-----

* I fork the m2e-scala project from sonatype and add the following feature
* remove of scala-library, scala-compiler, scala-dbc, scala-swing from "Maven Dependencies" Container (under eclipse only)
* re-order JRE Container and Scala Container (to avoid scala.ScalaObject NotFound and CÂ° when use "Run As Scala Application")
* add Scala-tools.org catalog
